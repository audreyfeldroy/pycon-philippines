<p>The first PyCon Philippines will take place on June 30 and July 1 in Manila, Philippines at UP Diliman. Speakers include five notable Filipino software developers and four international speakers travelling to the Philippines just for the event.</p>

<p>“I’m honored and overwhelmed by the support of the Philippine technical community.  The Philippines is a hotbed for innovation in the tech world,” said Daniel Greenfeld, invited keynote speaker and CTO of Consumer.io, a tech startup based in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>PyCon Philippines has the support and sponsorship of Smart, Auberon Solutions, Cartwheel Web, GitHub, 10gen, Chikka, PhilHealth, Kite Systems, and the Python Software Foundation.</p>

<p>“I feel extreme pride to be part of the first PyCon Philippines. As a Filipino and Pythonista, I couldn't ask for anything more epic,” said Bryan Veloso, invited keynote speaker and world-renowned designer of GitHub and Hello! Ranking.  Veloso lives in Los Angeles, California and dropped everything to book his flight for Manila as soon as he heard the conference announcements.</p>

<p>About PyCon Philippines:<br/>
  PyCon Philippines is the first Python programming conference held in the Philippines. PyCon is a volunteer run effort that brings together programmers from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels into a friendly, cooperative environment in order to educate, inspire, and work together - building relationships that transcend the event and can turn into lifelong friendships or even very impressive business alliances. When a PyCon occurs, thanks to social media, tens of thousands of developers around the world avidly follow the Twitter tweets, Facebook posts, and blog posts related to the event. The host nation, attendees, and sponsors are featured around the world before, during, and after.</p>

<p>About Python:<br/>
  Python is one of the most widely-used programming languages for science, engineering, robotics, entertainment, Information Technology (IT), and web development. It is used by top organizations such as Google, NASA, Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and Facebook.</p>
